# Week 12: DevSphere - Your Github Profile

## React Side Effects, API and Client Routing

## Introduction

- For this project, you'll be building a simple Github Profile using React and calling the open Github API.
- You will need to know how to use `axios` and `useEffect` hook together to render data on React state using `useState` hook.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup

- [ ]  Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ]  Clone your OWN version of the repository in your terminal
- [ ]  CD into the project base directory `cd Week12_DevShere`
- [ ]  Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ]  Start up the app using `npm run dev`
- [ ]  Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`. Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ]  Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2a: MVP

- [ ]  Use Github's open API `https://api.github.com/users/<your-github-username>` to render your profile data in `Home.jsx` file.
- [ ]  Also render your repositories in the `Projects.jsx` file. Read the comments in that file.
- [ ]  Make sure your Home page looks like the [The Home preview image](https://github.com/gabischool/Week12_DevShere/blob/main/home.png)
- [ ]  Make sure your Projects page looks like the [The Projects preview image](https://github.com/gabischool/Week12_DevShere/blob/main/projects.png)
- [ ]  Make sure to setup `react-router-dom` in `App.jsx` file and setup the link in `Navbar.jsx` file.
- [ ]  Find everywhere it shows `TODO` and follow the instructions.



### Task 3: Stretch Goals

- [ ] Convert your project's style to Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Add new page that has contact information.
- [ ] Host your project on Netlify and share the link.

## Submission Format
